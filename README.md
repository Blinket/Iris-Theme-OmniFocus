# Iris theme for OmniFocus

I've created a theme inspired by Evernote color. Omnifocus has always been making my eyes bleed and needed something softer while easy on the focus.

### Feature
* Due task is highlighted so I have no excuse for missing them.
* Soon due are blue

### Todo
* I'm not quite happy with the left sidebar but for now it does the job.
